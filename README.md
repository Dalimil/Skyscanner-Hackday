#Skyscanner & Make it Social - HACKDAY (Edinburgh, 3-4th Oct 2015)

**Team:** [Dalimil Hajek](https://github.com/dalimil), [Miguel Jaques](https://github.com/seuqaj114)

When attending international conferences, festivals and other events:
* People come from different countries and arrive at different times
* You have to ask everyone what time they are going to arrive
* Many people don't come at all because they find the organization too complicated

*Our web application solves all of these problems:*
* You can easily set up groups and invite your friends *(Make it Social API)*
* Optimal flights are found - optimizing arrival times and minimizing the cost *(Skyscanner API)*
* You can see the arrival times of your friends and possibly other flight information *(Make it Social API)*
